#+title: mouthpiecer-tui

* About

*mouthpiecer-tui* is a Python based terminal user interface to a [[https://www.knack.com][Knack]] database.

The Mouthpiecer Knack front end can be found here: [[https://aleksozolins.knack.com/mouthpiecer#home/]]

- The app is meant for individual users to manage their French Horn mouthpiece collection (really).
- Users can also view the collections of other "mouthpiecers" and can arrange mouthpiece trades as well.
- For now, some features have been removed from the front end and will be re-introduced as the cli develops.

Ultimately, the tui should exactly mirror the feature-set of the web front end.
